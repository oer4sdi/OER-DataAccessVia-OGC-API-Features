# OER_DataAccessVia OGC API Features (Work In Progress)

This repository contains all the relevant materials involved to create and publish the Open Educational Resource (OER) on Data Access Via OGC API Features. The repository will cover the following aspects.

- A breif introduction and background to OGC API and its importance.
- Explaination with help of a usecase
- Technical guidance on practical application of the concepts starting from installation, setup of IDE,
  discussion of common challenges and expalination of a happy path to the fully working solution.

### Content:

- Chapter 1: Overview
- Chapter 2: Background to the domain of study and its significance
- Chapter 3: Technical tutorial on the installation and usage
- Chapter 4: Wrap up and self assessments

The OER is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their skills in developing applications for near-real-time data.

#### Prerequisites:

Users should have some basic knowledge of Python and it would be great to have some experience with Docker and Jupyter notebooks as well. However, the OER guides you through all these technologies and can also be used to gain some initial practical experience with them.

### How to use the OER Module

The OER is implemented as an [H5P](https://h5p.org/) module that can be downloaded and embedded into any H5P runtime environment, such as:

- Learning management systems based on Moodle or Ilias
- H5P editing environments such as the [H5P Official Editor](https://h5p.org/) or the lightweight [LUMI H5P editor](https://lumi.education/)
- Content managament systems such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) with "H5P" plugin installed

Simply download just the H5P file, upload it to one of the environments and use it from there...
